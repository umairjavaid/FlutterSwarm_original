- **Priority ranking**: Orders improvements by impact and feasibility
- **Evidence collection**: Gathers supporting data for recommendations

### Agent Assignment Optimization

## ðŸ”„ Workflow Modification Capabilities

### 1. **Step Reordering**
```python
async def _reorder_workflow_steps(workflow, improvement):
    # Optimizes execution sequence based on dependencies and efficiency
    new_order = improvement.proposed_changes.get("new_order", [])
    # Reorders steps while maintaining dependency constraints
```

### 2. **Parallel Execution**
```python
async def _parallelize_workflow_steps(workflow, improvement):
    # Enables concurrent execution of independent tasks
    parallel_groups = improvement.proposed_changes.get("parallel_groups", [])
    # Removes blocking dependencies within parallel groups
```

### 3. **Dynamic Step Management**
```python
async def _add_workflow_step(workflow, improvement):
    # Adds quality checks, validation steps, or missing functionality
    
async def _remove_workflow_step(workflow, improvement):
    # Removes redundant or unnecessary steps
    # Cleans up dependencies and references
```

### 4. **Resource Reallocation**
```python
async def _reallocate_resources(workflow, improvement):
    # Optimizes CPU, memory, and agent time allocation
    # Updates resource constraints and availability
```

## ðŸ“Š Performance Monitoring & Analysis

### Real-time Metrics Collection
- **Step-level timing**: Execution time tracking for each workflow step
- **Quality assessment**: Output quality scoring and validation
- **Resource monitoring**: CPU, memory, and agent utilization tracking
- **Error pattern analysis**: Failure mode identification and classification

### Bottleneck Detection
- **Statistical analysis**: Identifies outlier performance steps
- **Agent overload detection**: Monitors agent capacity and load
- **Resource contention**: Detects competing resource usage
- **Dependency chain analysis**: Identifies blocking dependencies

### Efficiency Calculation
```python
def _calculate_efficiency_score(self, feedback: WorkflowFeedback) -> float:
    time_efficiency = min(1.0, feedback.target_completion_time / feedback.overall_completion_time)
    quality_factor = feedback.quality_score
    error_factor = 1.0 - (len(feedback.failures) / max(1, len(feedback.step_results)))
    return (time_efficiency + quality_factor + error_factor) / 3.0
```

    workflow_id="flutter_app_dev",
    step_results=[
        WorkflowStepResult("ui_design", "design_agent", "completed", execution_time=45.0, quality_score=0.9),
        WorkflowStepResult("implementation", "dev_agent", "failed", execution_time=120.0, quality_score=0.3),
        WorkflowStepResult("testing", "test_agent", "pending", execution_time=0.0)
    ],
    agent_performance={
        "dev_agent": AgentPerformanceMetrics("dev_agent", "implementation", current_load=0.95)
    },

## ðŸŽ¯ Impact

The adaptive workflow modification system creates an **intelligent, self-optimizing development environment** where:

1. **Workflows automatically improve** based on real-time performance data
2. **Bottlenecks are proactively identified** and resolved through LLM reasoning
3. **Agent assignments are optimized** for specialization and load balancing  
4. **Resource allocation adapts** to changing project requirements
5. **Quality and efficiency continuously increase** through iterative refinement

This creates a truly **intelligent multi-agent system** that thinks and adapts like expert Flutter developers while maintaining the coordination and efficiency of automated tooling.

**The goal of creating agents that "think and act like expert Flutter developers, using tools as their hands, but making all decisions through reasoning" has been achieved.** âœ¨
